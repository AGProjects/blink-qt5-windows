--------------

Blink Qt5 now works on Windows up till Jul 19th, 2023.
   
Blink Qt6 does not work on Windows because some Qt6 libraries are not available:

   a. QT6 Web Engine component is not yet available for msys2-mingw64 enviroment

   b. Python extensions for QT6 web engine do not compile on mingw64 GCC compiler
      yet, pyqt6webengine is still work in progress:
